## How to run

Install all required node packages with
```
npm install
```

Than run the server with
```
npm run dev
# or
npm run build
npm run start
```

Forward port (depending on setup) e.g.

```
sudo ufw allow 4430
```

You might have to change the ip addr in the server.js file (see bottom of file).
